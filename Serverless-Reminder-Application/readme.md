# Serverless Reminder Application

In this Project we will be implementing a serverless reminder application.
The application will load from an S3 bucket and run in browser
.. communicating with Lambda and Step functions via an API Gateway Endpoint
Using the application you will be able to configure reminders for 'Scheduling Meeting Reminders' to be sent using email.

This Project consists of 5 stages :-

- STAGE 1 : Configure Simple Email service 
- STAGE 2 : Add a email lambda function to use SES to send emails for the serverless application 
- STAGE 3 : Implement and configure the state machine, the core of the application 
- STAGE 4 : Implement the API Gateway, API and supporting lambda function 
- STAGE 5 : Implement the static frontend application and test functionality **<= THIS STAGE**
